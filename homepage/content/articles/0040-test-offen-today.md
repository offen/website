# Test Offen today

We’re excited to present our first version that is officially ready for testing.

---

After we released our initial Offen v0.1.0-alpha.1 in January this year, we've been busy working on a successor version for the last six weeks. Based on the initial feedback, we have made major adjustments in the front and backend area.

We believe with these updates Offen has reached a level of functionality and stability that is ready for public testing. Your feedback is helping us take a step forward on our way to developing *a viable alternative to established web analytics tools.*

Although we have dug very deep, things may still contain issues. Therefore, we recommend using Offen in a production environment only for the brave. Also be aware that the upgrade path may be broken with upcoming releases.
