We optimize Offen to be as simple and easy for everyone to self host. *No additional software is required to run an instance* and hardware requirements are minimal. A basic VPS or even a Raspberry Pi will be all you need to get started.

Choose your preferred way of running Offen below. Be sure to check out our documentation as well. If you get stuck or need help, [file an issue][gh-issues], [tweet (@hioffen)][twitter] or [email][email].
